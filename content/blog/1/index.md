This is a blog + portfolio combo site which was made using Gatsby, 
React and TypeScript. It was adapted from [this template](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) and I lopped my previous portfolio website (built with Vite) on to it.

It was fun making this site üçì as I got to learn new technologies (like GraphQL). 

This blog uses Markdown to style posts.

I don't know if this is the best 'CMS' system for a blog but it seems to work for now. I also have another  ([wordpress](https://adnjoo.wordpress.com/)) blog that I made some posts on. 

I think perhaps I got used to writing Markdown for my Agile tickets at my previous job at Amazon, although a WYSIWYG editor (like Wordpress') might be useful too.
