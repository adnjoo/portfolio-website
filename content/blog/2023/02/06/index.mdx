To be honest I think my ideas were getting a bit stale in 2022 so to shake things up I decided to sign up for the [Goodreads challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/show/11633-2023-reading-challenge) to read 24 books in 2023.

Here are some notable books I've read this year:

1. How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World by Harry Browne 8/10
1. Atomic Habits by James Clear (it's all about the habit stacking) 9/10
1. The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss 8/10
1. Only the Paranoid Survive by Andrew S. Grove 7/10
1. The Design of Everyday Things by Donald Norman (great book on general design!) 8/10
1. The Thank You Economy by Gary Vaynerchuk 6/10

I hope to read more books..
