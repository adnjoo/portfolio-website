This is a blog + portfolio combo site which was made using Gatsby, 
React and TypeScript. It was adapted from this [blog template](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) with my previous portfolio website added to it.

It was fun making this site üçì as I got to learn new technologies (like GraphQL). 

This blog uses MDX (Markdown and JSX) for blog post content which allows you to embed JSX components. For example in the second blog post we can embed a Soundcloud component to play some audio.
