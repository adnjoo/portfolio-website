Meet Pi 🐈, my adorable orange furball with a heart as warm as his coat.
My partner and I found him on the street. We took him to a vet and got him cleaned of fleas, and antibiotics for cat respiratory infection.
He is very naughty, but he is also nice and purrs alot.

And then there's Beatrice 🐈‍⬛, affectionately known as Lil B. With her stunning white and grey fur, she's the epitome of elegance.
We got Beatrice from a local shelter at Petsmart. She is very nice and quiet (except when she is hungry).

These two furry friends bring immeasurable happiness 🥰 to my life.
