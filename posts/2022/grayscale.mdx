## Why I Grayscale Sites

Grayscaling on desktop and mobile devices is a powerful tool for enhancing focus and productivity.

In this blog post, I'll explain why I grayscale sites and how it can benefit you too.

### Desktop üñ•Ô∏è

To easily grayscale websites, I recommend the [Grayscale the Web extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/grayscale-the-web-save-si/mblmpdpfppogibmoobibfannckeeleag). It's simple to install and use, providing an effective way to reduce visual distractions online.

You can also add a site to be grayscaled every time you visit it.

### iPhone üì≤

To grayscale iPhone, I personally use the triple click method (right side) to turn on grayscale and limit addictive apps e.g. Instagram etc.

This [tutorial from Verge](https://www.theverge.com/23637672/grayscale-iphone-android-pixel-samsung-galaxy-how-to) might help.

### Color üé®

Bright, vivid colors on websites/apps are designed to capture and hold our interest.

In "Hooked", Eyal discusses how products are designed to create habit-forming behaviors.

### Conclusion

Grayscaling might be a good way to manage addicting behaviors. I personally use it on e.g. Spotify | Soundcloud, which helps me spend less time on sites and more time doing other stuff :)

I find it a little funny as I met another Facebook engineer who also grayscaled his iPhone to limit time spent on addictive apps.
