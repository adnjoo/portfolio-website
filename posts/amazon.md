Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹ I wanted to share my experience working at Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a front-end engineer in the CloudFormation team. I joined AWS in July 2022 and worked there until January 2023.

During my time at AWS, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project which was the Feature Spotlight, which helps users learn how to use CloudFormation. I championed this project and worked closely with the product team to build out its specs and requirements.

Working at AWS was my first experience at a FAANG company, and it was an incredible opportunity to learn and grow as a front-end engineer. At Amazon I used the unique systems to build and deploy full stack applications including [brazil build](https://gist.github.com/terabyte/15a2d3d407285b8b5a0a7964dd6283b0), ðŸš° [Pipelines](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/amazon-notable-systems/), CR (code review - Amazon lingo for PR), Isengard and much more.

Some other interesting pieces of Amazon culture include the concept of the [flywheel](https://www.samseely.com/posts/the-amazon-flywheel-part-1), [2 way doors](https://fs.blog/reversible-irreversible-decisions/), and [2 pizza teams](https://jasoncrawford.org/two-pizza-teams) to aid agility when developing software in large organizations. There are also the leadership principles ([LPs](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles)) which help guide Amazonians to make better decisions; some of the LPs that I like are Invent and Simplify, and Be Curious.

Unfortunately, I was laid off in late January, which was tough to deal with. However, I am still grateful for the experience and the skills that I gained during my time at AWS. As a front-end engineer, I feel that my skills have improved, and I am now better equipped to tackle new challenges in my career.

Looking back, I am reminded that setbacks are a part of life, and they can help us grow and become better. I am excited to see what new opportunities await in the future.
