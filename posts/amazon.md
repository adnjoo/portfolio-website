Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹ I wanted to share my experience working at Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a front-end engineer in the CloudFormation team. I joined AWS in July 2022 and worked there until February 2023.

During my time at AWS, I had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects. One project that I am particularly proud of is the Feature Spotlight, which helps users learn how to use CloudFormation. I championed this project and worked closely with the product team to build out its specs and requirements.

Working at AWS was my first experience at a FAANG company, and it was an incredible opportunity to learn and grow as a front-end engineer. I also got to use TypeScript in a production environment for the first time, which was a great learning experience e.g. using generics to create reusable components.

Unfortunately, I was laid off in late January, which was tough to deal with. However, I am still grateful for the experience and the skills that I gained during my time at AWS. As a front-end engineer, I feel that my skills have improved, and I am now better equipped to tackle new challenges in my career.

Looking back, I am reminded that setbacks are a part of life, and they can help us grow and become better. I am excited to see what new opportunities await me as I continue to work hard, apply myself, and study more computer science.
