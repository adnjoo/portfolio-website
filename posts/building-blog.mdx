title: 'Building a blog with Next.js 🖥️'
date: '2024-01-21'

This website was created using Next.js 14 (app router) and ~~[daisyui](https://daisyui.com/)~~ [radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/), with the blog posts being generated programmatically from [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (markdown with JSX).

The use of ~~daisyui~~ radix provides pre-built UI components that makes it simpler to iterate quickly. Additionally, deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is straightforward 🌱☀️.

The project structure is organized as follows:

```markdown
- src: includes the source code
- src/app: houses the pages
- public: stores static files
- posts: contains the blog posts
```

Within the `/src/app` folder, there are several files, including:

```markdown
- /blog/[slug].tsx: a dynamic route for blog posts
- page.tsx: the home page
- layout.tsx: a root component that wraps all pages
```

I got help from from Max Leiter (1) to make this site's blog posts look better e.g. syntax highlighting for code blocks.

{/* 🌞/🌚 mode (at the top ⬆️) is toggled with [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes). */}

Overall, using Next.js streamlines the creation of this website, and enables features like SSR and SSG. 

Source **{'<'}/{'>'}** code is available on GitHub (2).
