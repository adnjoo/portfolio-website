Hello this is my first blog post. This site was built with Next.js and Material UI.

The blog posts are programmatically generated from markdown files.

Material UI makes it easier to iterate quickly as the UI components are pre-built. It's also easy to deploy on Vercel.

Hopefully I can write more posts in the future.
