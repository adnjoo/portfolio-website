Hello this is my first blog post:

Building a blog and portfolio website with Next.js and Material UI was a fun and educational experience. At first, I attempted to use Gatsby and HTML/CSS but then tried out Next.JS with Material UI (MUI).

One of the key advantages of using Next.js for my website was the ability to use Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG). This allowed me to have faster loading times and improved performance, which was crucial for a good UX. Additionally, MUI provided me with pre-built UI components, which saved me a lot of time and effort.

I had so much fun building and learning with Next.js and MUI. ThThe future of my website is exciting, and I look forward to continuing to improve and add new features in the future.
