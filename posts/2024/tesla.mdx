In this review I will be talking about my 2023 Tesla model 3 (white), and some pros and cons of ownership.

I bought my Tesla in December 2022, after there was a price drop of $3,750. Unfortunately, there was another price drop of $3,750 shortly after, which I missed out on ðŸ˜Ÿ. This is my partner and Iâ€™s only car as we usually work from home (WFH).

We called him/her Stuart, like Stuart Little.

### Pros

- Looks - nice :3
- Buying experience - honestly I don't like going to dealerships (stealerships). Buying from Tesla using the app was the best car buying experience ever.
- Quiet - this is one of the most pleasant driving experiences ever as I donâ€™t have to listen to the drone of a CVT engine sounding like itâ€™s dying.
- Comfortable - nice vegan leather seats. I honestly canâ€™t tell the difference.
- Tech - Has a cool web browser in the car.
- Fast - I love the speed of the car.
- Maintenance - didnâ€™t have to do any maintenance on my car which is amazing. I once had a 2012 VW GTI which had a turbocharger maintenance bill of e.g. $3k. Itâ€™s not fun to maintain an old car.
- Autopilot - Wow this thing is literally amazing. It feels like the future of cars as I donâ€™t have to drive, the car just drives itself. Just be careful for edge cases - sometimes it turns jerkily for some reason, and Iâ€™m like why did you (car) do that lol.

### Cons

- Weak windshield - had a crack in the windshield and had to pay $800 to swap it out
- Inconvenience of charging - sometimes you have to wait if superchargers are full. Also the charging takes forever like 30-40 minutes.
  - Itâ€™s better if you have a house to charge your car in.

- Depreciation - ðŸ˜¢ - carmax came back with $24k (05.2024), when MSRP is [$38,990](https://www.tesla.com/model3/design#overview)

Ironically, my previous car was a C-HR ðŸ¤£

- Bad for road trips - I drove down from SF to LA (~**380 miles)** several times and for some reason I had to charge the car 3-4 times each way (e.g. Santa Nella, Kettleman City, Buttonwillow). This was confusing as I thought the range was rated to 270 miles. However, if you go faster (like 80-85mph on I-5) the range drops much faster.
- Sun roof - whoever decided to install the mandatory sun roof should have used a moonroof instead. The reason for this is that in the summer the car heats up. I know Tesla says itâ€™s supposed to reflect UV light but the car gets really hot if out in the heat, and it sucks for roadtrips (my brain ðŸ§  literally feels hot).

### Conclusion

In conclusion, although it was fun owning an electric car, if I could go back in time I would have just bought a RAV4 or a Subaru Forester instead (less depreciation), and just rented a Tesla for fun when Iâ€™m e.g. traveling.

For now though, Iâ€™m keeping the car since itâ€™s pretty chill and I donâ€™t really drive that much. Also it's fun to watch Netflix in the car when I'm charging.
