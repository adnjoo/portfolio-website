Notes on DDIA - Kleppmann

543 pages

3 parts, 12 chapters

## part 1 - foundations of data systems

## c1 - RSM

database, cache, search index, stream processing, batch processing

### reliability

fault tolerant / resilient

### scalability

load parameters

response time - p95 p99 p999

tail latencies

SLO (service level objective) SLA (service level agreement)

scaling up (vertical - more powerful machine 🤖)

scaling out (horizontal)

elastic systems

### maintainability

majority of the cost of software is maintenance - 🐞 bugs, looking into failures, adapting it, paying tech debt, adding new features

### operability

### simplicity - big ball of mud

symptoms - explosion of state space, tight coupling of modules, tangled dependencies, inconsistent naming, hacks etc.

accidental complexity (mosely and marks, 2006) [link](https://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf)

abstraction 👍

### evolvability / plasticity

### high level takeaway - RSM 😎

## c2 - data models, query languages

## SQL (based on Codd 1970)

data stored in relations (tables), where reach relation is an unordered collection of tuples (rows)

query optimizer 🌈

## nosql (2010s) 🌲

impedance mismatch (between application code + storage layer)

CODASYL model

better for document-like structure (tree of one-to-many relationships)

declarative vs imperative languages

### mapreduce

map (aka collect) 🗾

reduce (aka fold/inject) 💉

### graph-like data models 〽️

graph consists of vertices/nodes and edges/relationships

### triple store

SPO (subject predicate/verb object) (jim, likes, bananas)

RDF

SPARQL

Datalog

unusual data models - GenBank (genome), particle physics (LHC), information retrieval/full text search

### high level takeaway 😎

3 types - relational, document (NoSQL), graph (NoSQL)

## c3 - internals of storage systems

optimize for transactional workloads, analytics

log structured and page oriented storage engines (B-trees 🌲)

compaction ♻️

SSTable (sorted string table)
red-black trees, AVL trees

memtable

Google’s BigTable paper (2006) [link](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf)

Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree)

Bloom filter 🌹

### B-tree (most widely used indexing structure) 🌲

depth of O(log n)

write-ahead log (WAL)

fuzzy search

Memcached (in-memory KV stores)

OLAP (online analytic processing)

The process of getting data into a data warehouse (is called Extract-Transform-Load (ETL))

Google Dremel (2010) [link](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/36632.pdf)

bitmap encoding

### high level takeaway 😎

OLTP system - user facing

OLAP system - BA facing

log structured school (append only) e.g. Cassandra, LSM tree

update-in place - B-trees

## c4 - serialization

encoding/serialization/marshalling

decoding/parsing/deserialization/unmarshalling

JSON, XML, CSV

Apache Thrift (Facebook) / Protocol Buffers (Google) (protobuf) - binary encoding libraries

protobuf does not have list/array datatype but has `repeated` marker

Apache Avro

data flows 🌊

data outlives code

database snapshots 📸

SOA - service oriented architecture aka microservices

2 popular approaches to web services : REST 😌 and SOAP 🧼

OpenAPI Specification (OAS)

RPC (remote procedure call) - tries to make a request look like calling a function/method

message broker aka message queue

actor model 👨‍🎤

### high level takeaway

- rolling upgrades - evolvability
- textual formats (e.g. JSON, XML, CSV) are widespread
- binary schema-driven formats like Thrift, Protocol Buffers, Avro allow compact encoding but the downside is the data needs to be decoded for humans
- data-flows include databases, RPC/REST APIs, and async message passing using message brokers/actors

## part 2 - distributed data

why distribute data - scalability, fault tolerance/ high availability, latency

shared-memory architecture 🗼

shared-disk architecture

shared-nothing architecture (horizontal scaling)

- each machine is a node

2 common ways

- replication (provides redundancy)
- paritioning/sharding

## c5 - replication

difficulty is in handling changes to data

3 popular algorithms

- single-leader
- multi-leader
- leaderless

each node that stores a copy of db is called a `replica`

leader-based replication aka active/passive aka master/slave

leader/master/primary → (replication log/change stream) → followers/read replicas/slaves/secondaries/hot standbys

synchronous vs asynchronous

chain replication (Azure storage)

log sequence number (Postgres), binlog coordinates (MySQL)

handling node outages

- follower failure - catch-up recovery 🏃
- leader failure - failover 🛑
  - GitHub 2012-09-14, out-of-date MySQL follower promoted to leader, [link](https://github.blog/2012-09-14-github-availability-this-week/)

replication logs implementation

- write-ahead log (WAL )shipping
- logical (row-based) log replication
- trigger-based replication
  - triggers, stored procedures

eventual consistency

replication lag 🎮

read-after-write consistency aka read-your-writes consistency 📕

monotonic reads - won’t see time ⌚ go backwards

consisten prefix reads

## multi-leader replication

aka master-master / active-active replication

conflict resolution

CRDT - conflict-free replicated datatypes Riak 2.0

mergeable persistent data structures

operational transformation - Etherpad / Google Docs

replication topology - circular 🟡, star/tree ⭐🌲, all-to-all

version vectors

## leaderless replication

Amazon dynamo 🧨 [link](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf)

ACID - (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability)

read request sent to several nodes in parallel

quorum condition:
`w + r > n` (write nodes, read nodes, n replicas 🖥️)

leaderless replication ↔ use case requires HA and low latency (tolerate occasional stale reads)

sloppy quorum

last write wins (LWW) - discard concurrent writes

- achieves eventual convergence at the cost of durability

### high level takeaway

- high availability (HA)
- disconnected operation
- latency
- scalability

3 main approaches

- single-leader replication (pros - no conflict resolution)
- multi-leader replication (cons - weak consistency guarantee)
- leaderless

replication can be synchronous or asynchronous

strange effects of replication lag

- read-after-write conistency
- monotonic reads
- consistent prefix reads

## c6 - partitioning

shard (MongoDB), region (HBase), tablet (Bigtable), vnode (Cassandra), vBucket (Couchbase)

unfair partitioning - skewed

partition with high load - hot spot ☀️

hash function to get partition for a key 🔑

consistent hashing aka hash partitioning (Karger et al) [link](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall09/cos518/papers/chash.pdf)

rebalancing (moving load from one node in cluster to another)

request routing / service discovery

Apache ZooKeeper (keep track of cluster metadata)

### high level takeaway

- key range partitioning
- hash partitioning

- document-partitioned indexes (local indexes)
- term-partitioned indexes (global indexes)

## c7 - transactions

ACID criteria

BASE (basically available, soft state, eventual consistency)

Atomicity - abortability

Consistency - invariants

Isolation - serializability

Durability

single vs multi-object transactions

transaction isolation

- read committed - no dirty reads, no dirty writes

databases prevent dirty writes by using row level locks

nonrepeatable read/ read skew - snapshot isolation 📸

atomic write operation ⚛️

write skew

### serializability

- isolation levels are hard to understand
- solution is serializable isolation
  - literal transaction execution in order (VoltDB, Redis, Datomic)
  - two-phase locking
    - predicate locks
    - index-range locks
  - serializable snapshot isolation (SSI)\

### high level takeaway

- transaction abort
- for complex access patterns, transactions can reduce errors
- concurrency control
  - isolation levels include read committed, snapshot isolation aka repeatable read, serializable
- examples of race conditions 🏎️
  - dirty reads
  - dirty writes
  - read skew (nonrepeatable reads)
  - lost updates
  - write skew
  - phantom reads
- implementing serializable transactions
  - literal transaction execution in order
  - 2PL
  - SSI

## c8 - trouble with distributed systems

partial failures - nondeterministic

TCP flow control aka congestion avoidance aka backpressure

time-of-day clock (NTP) and monotonic clock ⏰

Byzantine faults

Byzantine fault-tolerant - even if some nodes are malicious

### high level takeaway

- first step is to detect fault

## c9 - consistency and consensus

eventual consistency / convergence

linearizability aka atomic consistency

- recency guarantee on reads/writes of a register

CAP theorem 🧢

consistency, availability, partition tolerance - pick 2 out of 3

types of windows 🪟

- tumbling window
- hopping window
- sliding window
- session window

### high level takeaway
