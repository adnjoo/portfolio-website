### Everyone collects something: whether it's [cars](https://www.youtube.com/@jaylenosgarage), [motorbikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=O4iGNXsqghs), [art](https://www.artelier.com/post/the-15-most-interesting-private-art-collections-from-around-the-world), or [Rick Owens clothes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeNVb5BEQ3s).

Maybe even memories, or experiences..

For me, I collect watches. 

Why watches? Watches are portable, and also in [Singapore](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/23/fashion/singapore-watches-collectors.html) / SEA / [NYC](https://revolutionwatch.com/nyc-watch-guy-the-serious-watch-collector-who-doesnt-take-it-seriously-tcp/) , it can be a relatively popular hobby.

### Collecting watches can be fun for several reasons:

- aesthetics - they look pretty cool..

<img src='https://www.europeanwatch.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Hero-FP-Journe-Chronometre-Bleu.jpg' width='300' />
- thrill of the hunt - some watches are kinda difficult to get. For example, trying to get a [Rolex Submariner](https://www.rolex.com/en-us/watches/submariner) at retail is pretty hard.
You need e.g. a buy history with the sales team to get the desirable pieces (like stainless steel sports). 
  - One time, I was lucky enough to stumble upon a GMT BLNR 116710 in Macau for retail price. Unfortunately I sold it too early üò≠ before the price shot up.
- diversifying assets - some watch brands tend to hold value quite well e.g. Rolex, Patek Philippe. You could even make money on them
if you hold them long [enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arBJLV3P2bM).
  - in contrast, cars tend to [depreciate](https://adnjoo.com/blog/tesla) faster and require more maintenance (storage, upkeep). Mechanical watches are relatively
    reliable, and low upkeep in comparison.
- mechanical and fun to play with - maybe it's a guy thing. Like guys like gears, and tech and stuff like that ü§£
- networking - you can go to fun watch events, if you want
  - I went to a few of these in Singapore and even got to see some crazy watches like the Nautilus and a [Zeitwerk](https://www.alange-soehne.com/us-en/timepieces/zeitwerk) Minute Repeater 
- fun to read about - some of my favorite watch blogs are [Hodinkee](https://hodinkee.com/) and [ABTW](https://www.ablogtowatch.com/)
- you can bring them around the world - can't bring your Porsche 911 to e.g. Tokyo or London

### Some cons of ‚åöÔ∏è hobby are:
- security - be careful with them :P
  - they can get dings and so on..
- can be bad for your wallet (or neutral)

### SOTC 2024

My collection has been pretty stable so far comprising: Rolex Explorer 1 [114270](https://www.fratellowatches.com/exploring-evergreens-the-rolex-explorer-ref-114270/), & [Tudor Black Bay 58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nmvuhrocbwg) (for scuba diving üòÇü§ø). \* cool marketing (3)

[Omega Swatch](https://www.swatch.com/en-us/bioceramic-moonswatch.html) (fun), and [Apple Watch SE](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-se/) (for running, iOS integration).

The collection used to be quite extensive, going up to 8-10 watches but they've mostly been sold by now in favor of keeping it simple.

Tbh I don't even wear them that much, but maybe if there's a formal event or fancy dinner it's fun to play dress up and pretend I'm James Bond üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, I hope you enjoyed reading about my watch hobby. Here's a designy style video..
