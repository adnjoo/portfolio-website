Book review of Refactoring UI by Schoger, Wathan (2018)

It's about designing for the web and is around 8 chapters, 252 pages long.

## c1 scratch

- start with feature not shell 🐢
- detail comes later
- choose a personality for your design
- typography
    - serif (classical)
    - rounded sans serif (playful)
    - neutral san serif (plain)
- colors
    - blue 💙 - safe/familiar
    - gold 💛 - expensive/sophisticated
    - pink 💕 - fun/not so serious
- border-radius - larger more playful, none - serious
- language - less personal tone (more official), more causal tone - friendlier

### limit your choices

- define systems in advance
- design by process of elimination

## c2 hierarchy

- border instead of font size
- softer color for secondary text instead of tiny font size
- stick to 2/3 colors 💛💓💚
- 2 font weights usually enough e.g. normal font and heavier font
    - stay away from fonts under 400

### emphasize by de-emphasizing

### labels are last resort

- combine labels and values
- de-emphasize labels

### separate visual hierarchy from document hierarchy

- titles should be small

balance weight and contrast

e.g. lower contrast of icon by giving it a softer color

### semantics are secondary

- primary actions should be obvious
- secondary actions - clear but not prominent
- tertiary actions - discoverable but unobtrusive

## c3 layout + spacing

- more white space

dense UIs 🌵

- design system - `16px` is a good number to start with

### grids are overrated

- percentage based width
- e.g. login card - max-width, only shrink when screen is smaller than that

### relative sizing doesn’t scale

### avoid ambiguous spacing

## c4 designing text

- type system
    - modular scale (golden ratio)
    - hand-crafted scale
- avoid `em` units - stick to `px` or `rem`
- fonts - neutral sans-serif (Helvetica) or system font stack
- ignore typefaces with less than 5 weights e.g. 10+ weights
- headlines - tighter letter-spacing & shorter lowercase letters (x-height)
- smaller sizes - wider letter-spacing & taller lowercase letters
- wisdom of the crowd - e.g. https://fonts.google.com/?stroke=Sans+Serif&sort=popularity
    - Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Inter … (sans serif)
- steal from people who care 🥷

### keep line length in check

- e.g. 45-75 characters per line

use different widths in the same content area

### baseline, not center

- align text on baseline

### line height is proportional ⛩️

e.g. 1.5 is a good starting point

- narrow content e.g. shorter line-height like 1.5
- wide content - line-height as tall as 2
- extra line spacing for small text to make it easy for eyes 👀 to see where next line is when text wraps
- for large text line-height of e.g. 1 is ok
- line-height and font size are inversely proportional
    {/* - $line-height \propto \frac{1}{\text{font size}}$ */}

### not every link needs color

- you can use heaver font weight / darker color
- or underline / change color 💜 on hover

### align with readability in mind

- don’t center long-form text - left-align is better
- re-write text if you need to center a few blocks of text and one is a bit too long
- right-align numbers
- hyphenate justified text
- increase letter-spacing of all-caps text to improve readability 🤓

## c5 working with color

### ditch hex for HSL

(hue, saturation, lightness)

- hue - position on color wheel (degrees e.g.  0° is red)
- saturation - how colorful/vivid a color looks - 0% saturation is grey - 100% saturation is vibrant
- lightness - how close to black or white 🐼

HSL vs HSB (brightness) (design)

### u need more colors than u think

- color palette generator
- break palette into 3 categories
    - grays (8-10 shades) - start with really dark grey → white
    - primary color(s) - (5-10 lighter and darker shades)
    - accent colors e.g. red - destructive, yellow - warning, green - positive trend

### define shades up front

<img src='/images//2024/palette.png' width='400' />

yellow has higher perceived brightness than blue

### grays don’t have to be gray

- warm, cool gray

### accessible doesn’t have to be ugly

- WCAG - contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 / 3:1 (larger text)
- instead of using light text on dark colored background, use dark colored text on a light colored background

- rotating the hue

### don’t rely on color alone

- color blind - use icons
    - try contrast instead of different colors

## c6 creating depth

- emulate a light source 🔆

### light comes from above

### simulate light in UI

- since people generally look slightly downward to their screens, reveal a bit of the top edge and hide the bottom edge
- choose lighter color by hand instead of semi-transparent white - as simple overlaying of white can suck saturation out of underlying color

### inset elements

### use shadows to convey elevation

- shadows let you position elements on a virtual z-axis 🔳
- Small shadows with tight blur radius make an element feel slightly raised off, while larger shadows with more br make an element feel closer
    - the closer it feels, the more it attracts focus
- elevation system - e.g. 5 options

### 2 shadows

- e.g. direct light, ambient light

### even flat designs can have depth

- flat design (no shadows/gradients or effects that mimic how light interacts with things)

creating depth with color - lighter objects feel closer to us and darker objects feel further away

- solid shadows (flat design)

### overlap elements to create layers

- overlap images (invisible border/gap to avoid clashing)

## c7 working with images

- use good photos

### text needs consistent contrast

- add semi-transparent overlay to background image
- lower contrast of image
- colorize image
- add text shadow

### everything has an intended size

- don’t scale up icons
- try enclosing small icons in another shape
- don’t scale down screenshots
    - mobile screenshot
    - partial
    - simplified UI
- don’t scale down icons - use e.g. simplified icon

### beware UGC

- control shape & size
- prevent background bleed
    - try subtle inner box shadow or semi-transparent inner border

## c8 finishing touches

### supercharge the defaults

- e.g. replace bullets with icons, or padlock for security-related features

### add color with accent borders

- add color accent to top of card
- under nav items
- along side of alert message
- short accent under headline

### decorate your backgrounds

- change bg color
- slight gradient (use 2 hues no more than 30° apart)
- repeating patterns
- simple geometric shapes

### don’t overlook empty states

- emphasize CTA to encourage to take next step
- hide actions until user has created some content

### use fewer borders

- use box shadow or different bg colors
- add extra spacing

### think outside the box

- dropdown menu can be a section
- table can combine columns (if e.g. not sortable)
    - can also add images

## leveling up

### look for decision you wouldn’t have made

### rebuild your favorite interfaces

## conclusion

good intro to basic tips for e.g. web app design. Learned a little about illusion of light, design systems, and color theory
