In this blog post I'll talk about why you'd want to contribute to open source software (OSS) and how one might go about doing so.

### Why contribute?

- One reason to contribute is that it could help other people. 
- Another reason is that it simulates a work environment; this could be a 
good idea for e.g. students/interns or devs attempting to break into the tech industry. Some companies even hire based on OSS work e.g. GitLab and [37Signals](https://37signals.com/podcast/open-source-beyond-the-market/)
- Thirdly, contributing can help hone your skills.
- Fourthly, it's kind of a cool bragging right ü§£.

### How to contribute

I've kept track of my OSS contributions in this repo: [https://github.com/andrewnjoo/oss-contributions](https://github.com/andrewnjoo/oss-contributions)

One of my first tries at contributing was a fail ‚ùå. I tried to fix the get started documentation in the [react-rails](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails) repo. 

When adding `react-rails` to a rails project, there was an [install error](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails/issues/1324). I tried to fix this by specifying the [version](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails/pull/1325) in the get started docs, but it didn't go through as 
it would have required additional docs update (whenever there was a dependency upgrade) so the PR was closed.

My second try ‚úÖ came from working on a side project I had at the time ([xtrack.ing](https://github.com/adnjoo/xtrack)). 

I saw an opportunity to improve keyboard navigation & accessibility when using the [Tab](https://www.tremor.so/docs/ui/tabs) component in `tremor` (a React component library). I found that the underlying code was using [headlessui](https://headlessui.com/react/tabs) (a popular UI library)
so I made an issue and then a PR (to change a class from `focus:ring-0` to `focus:ring` ). This allowed you to see which tab is selected when you use your arrow keys to move around tabs.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, I would recommend contributing to open source as it's fun, you get to simulate a work environment, and you can make the world a better place (with software üòä).

I would recommend looking at e.g. OSS issue aggregating sites like https://up-for-grabs.net/#/ or https://goodfirstissue.dev/, or just whatever tool | framework etc. you're using.

Don't forget to read the contributor guidelines ([ex. NextJS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md)) as some repos can be quite large and have alot of things going on.
