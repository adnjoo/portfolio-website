title: '4 startups, 12 months'

### Why

I was inspired by [levels](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months) and [yongfook](https://blog.yongfook.com/12-startups-in-12-months.html) to make a 12 startups in 12 months project, starting from around July 2023 to July 2024.

However I want to put my own spin on it and make it 4 startups in 12 months so I can have a longer time frame (~90 days) to build each app.

The reasons to do this, is as levels says

```
Problem one: finishing
We creatives have one common problem: finishing things.
```

```
Problem two: launching
fear of failure
```

S1: bookkss

The first failed startup is [bookkss](https://bookkss.com) (July 2023 - September 2023)

The reason it failed was because it is challenging to get a good value proposition for a B2C app like bookkss (as an indie founder, 1 man orchestra) [1](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1451455052623745033) 

For example, if we examine https://goodreads.com (a competitor), it is not easy to say how the website generates revenue (ads, partnerships, payments)[2](https://www.thepassivevoice.com/how-does-goodreads-make-money/). Amazon bought this website for $150 million in 2013 [3](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/01/amazon-goodreads-elizabeth-gilbert/).

Imo, Amazon is buying sites like goodreads and IMDB in order to have a beach-head on where data and interest is flowing in literature and film media (respectively).

What went well was
1. the relatively fast iteration speed using vite (next time we'll use next)
2. it was fun to build :D

What I learned from this startup is to 
1. use a styling library for faster development like Material UI
2. to target B2B niches (AI, etc.) for indie hackers, see source 1
3. manage feature creep (lock down features of MVP) [4](https://fastercapital.com/content/Lean-Startup--Feature-Creep.html#Key-Takeaways-on-Lean-Startups-and-Feature-Creep) - build that out, and get feedback from users
4. switching from next to vite to then back to next (this was my bad as I enabled the beta App router and had really slow site speeds for some reason, I wasn't able to diagnose it so I switched to Vite which solved the slow speeds, but I lost SSR (for SEO) which I wanted so I'm in the process of switching back to Next. This is due to each review being kind of like a blog post so we need web crawlers like Google to show these information pieces up on SERPs. 
5. practice marketing i.e. any kind of activity aligned to growth, that does not involve building features [5](https://www.bannerbear.com/blog/one-year-of-marketing-a-saas-from-10k-to-20k-mrr/)
