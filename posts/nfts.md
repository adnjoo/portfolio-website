Here are some NFTs I've collected:

![](/images/nfts/gnars.png)
![](/images/nfts/goodboy.png)
![](/images/nfts/larva.png)
![](/images/nfts/lildougies.png)

I think the images are stored on IPFS. Some newer NFTs have CC0, store their image data on-chain, and even have DAOs e.g. [Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/).

I think that's more fun than locking the IP up, but I guess it also depends on the use case of the NFT.
