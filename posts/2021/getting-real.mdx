[Getting real](https://basecamp.com/gettingreal) is a book by the team at [37Signals](https://37signals.com/) about building software faster. 

It has about 14 chapters and is around 171 pages long.

### 1 starting line

> defensive companies can‚Äôt think ahead; they can only think behind. They don't lead, they follow.

build for yourself

fund yourself

- constraints force creativity

fix time + budget, flex scope

- pull back scope
    - prioritization, reality, flexibility

have an enemy

- microsoft project üëπ¬†vs basecamp üßó
- (Godin - be a better liar) [üîó](https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2005/05/01/8259747/index.htm)

it shouldn‚Äôt be a chore

### 2 stay lean

less mass

- mass is ^ by thick process, lock-ins, closed data formats, office politics etc.
- mass is v by JIT thinking, less software/less code, less features, simplicity, pared-down interface, OSS, open data formats, open culture

they can change their minds üß†

lower your cost of change

- emergence
    - emergent properties happen as a dynamic result of a system

the 3 musketeers

- use a team of 3 for v1

embrace constraints

be yourself

### 3 priorities

what‚Äôs the big idea

ignore details early onw

it‚Äôs a problem when it‚Äôs a problem

hire the right customers

scale later

### 4 feature selection

build half a product

it just doesn‚Äôt matter

start with no

hidden costs

can you handle it

forget feature requests

- read them then throw away

hold the mayo

### 5 process

race to running software

- get something up and running quickly

rinse + repeat

- work in iterations
    - don‚Äôt expect to get it perfect the first time; let it morph + evolve ü¶é

from idea to implementation

- brainstorm üß†‚õàÔ∏è¬†‚Üí sketches ‚Üí HTML ‚Üí coding

avoid preferences

- preferences are evil as they create more softwar
    - more options require more code
- make the call

done!

- decisions are temporary so make the call and move on
- ideas are just multipliers (max double digits) times execution (worth millions)
- test in the wild

shrink your time

- are you facing a Big problem?
    - break it down into smaller pieces

### 6 the organization

unity

- don‚Äôt split into silos

alone time

- get üí©¬†done

meetings are toxic

- set a timer
- invite as few people as possible
- have a clear agenda

seek and celebrate small victories

- the most important thing in SD is motivation
    - 4-hour quick wins (builds morale, ^ motivation, reaffirms team is ‚Üí right direction)

### 7 staffing

hire less and hire later

Brooks‚Äô law

> Adding people to a late software project makes it later (Fred Brooks)
> 

kick the tires üöó

- take potential new team members on a test drive

actions, not words

- judge hires on OSS contributions
    - quality of work
    - cultural perspective
    - level of passion
    - completion percentage
    - social match
- If you want something done, ask the busiest person you know

get well rounded individuals

u can‚Äôt fake enthusiasm

- happy + average > frustrated + great

wordsmiths

- hire good writers (when deciding over a designer, programmer, marketer, salesperson, etc.)
    - good writers know how to communicate
    

### 8 interface design

interface first

- design interface before you start programming
    - interface is your product

epicenter design

- start from core + build outward

3 state solution

- regular üíö blank ü§ç error üî¥

first impressions are important

get defensive

- when things go wrong

context over consistency

copy-wrighting is interface design

### 9 code

less software

- each time you increase code, your software grows *exponentially* more complicated
- keep code as simple as possible (KISS)
    - big ball of mud üü§
- solving 80% of the problem for 20% of the effort is a major win
- search for detours around writing more software
- complexity doesn‚Äôt scale linearly with size  (ganssle group)

optimize for happiness

code speaks

manage debt

open doors

- don‚Äôt seal in data, let it run wild
    - RSS feeds, APIs

### 10 words

there‚Äôs nothing functional about a functional spec

- don‚Äôt write them

> A ‚Äúspec‚Äù is close to useless. I have never seen a spec that was both big enough to be useful and accurate. - Linus Torvalds (from Linux: Linus On Specifications)
> 

don‚Äôt do dead docs

tell me a quick story üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

use real words

- use real words, not lorem ipsum

personify your product

### 11 pricing and signup

free samples

easy on, easy off

- easy signup, easy cancellation

### 12 promotion

hollywood launch ‚≠ê

- teaser ‚Üí preview ‚Üí launch

ride the blog wave

- can be more effective than advertising, and it‚Äôs cheaper

track your logs

- leave comments on blogs
- thank people for posting links
- create ‚Äòbuzz‚Äô page on site

inline upsell

name hook

- short, catchy, memorable and run with it

### 13 support

feel the pain

- DIY

answer quick

tough love

- decided not to support IE5 (7% of market)
- customer is right | customer isn‚Äôt always right

in fine forum

- people help one another

### 14 post launch

- issue major update 30 d after launch

- be open to change

### 15 conclusion

### conclusion

This is the 3rd book I‚Äôve read from team 37signals ([remote](https://basecamp.com/books/remote), [rework](https://basecamp.com/books/rework)). I really like their philosophy, which is to keep it simple and move fast. 

Amazon has a culture called [Day 1](https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/how-amazon-defines-and-operationalizes-a-day-1-culture/) which includes tactics like having a 2 pizza team, and [customer obsession](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles).

Overall I‚Äôd give it a ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ.
